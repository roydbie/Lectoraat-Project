Description: This project research and create a POC for the Leo Kannercollege in Leiden. The POC is for students from age 8 - 16 with ASS who have behaviour isseus.

Many students with ASS don't know how to deal with stress. They don't know when they have stress. This will go to aggresive behaviour. 

We asked ourselves: What if the student can see if they have stress so they can handle the way they have learned.

We are creating a POC what helps students with stress and ASS so they can see if they have stress and have to go out of the situation.
